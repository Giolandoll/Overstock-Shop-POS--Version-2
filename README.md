# Overstock-Shop-POS--Version-2
This program was a final project for my 2nd year of CAPE examinations in Highschool. The program is an updated version of my previous POS

PROBLEM CONTEXT
The shopkeeper would open the software each day when he arrived. The shopkeeper would enter
the default password and import all of the data from files before performing any kind of
calculations. Customer service is only then possible. The shopkeeper retrieves each item in the store when a customer comes in and places an order. The shopkeeper then logs in, chooses each of the requested items by typing its name, and moves
on to enter the quantity of each item. The system does the subsequent computations, updating the
stock quantity for each item, and prints out the subtotal and a receipt if necessary. Furthermore, if a customer intends to take products and pay later, the shopkeeper keeps a notepad with their
names, phone numbers, and total. At the end of each week, the shopkeeper checks the inventory file and makes a report of what
items are out of stock and those that are low in quantity and sends these to his supplier

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM
Issue 1: Current system requires the owner to select an option to import the database
holding the items sold by the shop. If this is not imported then the system is unable to do
any calculations. 
Issue 2: The shop owner/keeper needs to manually create a report on the number of items
sold and the total earned for the month or week.
Issue 3: Shop keeper needs to call the program developer to change the password if they
wish to have it changed or if they forgot it.
Issue 4: When entering values for any function, there is no error recognition, which
allows for extraneous data and miscellaneous results.
Issue 5: The shopkeeper uses a notebook to store the information of those who have taken
items, with the intent of paying later.
Issue 6: The shopkeeper, when searching for the stock amount for an item, has to enter
the full name of the item, which increases the time taken to serve a customer. 
Issue 7: The shopkeeper has to reenter all items into the system if he/she wishes to take
out an item that is deemed not fit to sell.


SYSTEM OBJECTIVES
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
Program will be able to do calculations for the owner.  System tracks the stock amounts by automatically updating the database of the products
sold throughout the day.
System will output a receipt of purchase for each sale throughout the day when requested.
System will give alert to notify the owner that a stock amount has fallen to zero. 
The program will import the data from the database automatically. 
The program will generate an in-depth report about the number of items sold and the total
earned.
The program will have a password system with the ability to change the password.
The program will allow for the storage of customer names, phone numbers and money
owed for items they took with the intent of paying later. 
The program will allow for the locating of an item using a unique item code given to the
item when it is added to the system. This unique code may also be used to add the item to an
order. 
The program will allow for the deletion of an item from the database.
